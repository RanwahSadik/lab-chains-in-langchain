DNA contains the information needed to build and maintain an organism, including the proteins that make up our cells and tissues. \\n\\nHaving DNA in every cell ensures that each cell has the necessary genetic information to carry out its specific functions and to replicate itself accurately during cell division. This ensures that the genetic information is passed on to the next generation of cells. \\n\\nAdditionally, DNA is constantly being used by cells to carry out processes such as protein synthesis, cell division, and repair. Having DNA in every cell allows for the coordination of these processes and ensures that the organism functions properly as a whole. \\n\\nIn summary, every cell in our body contains DNA because it is essential for the proper functioning and development of all living organisms.'"

       "\"Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun acting on the Earth's oceans. The gravitational pull of the moon causes the water on the side of the Earth facing the moon to bulge out, creating a high tide. At the same time, there is a high tide on the opposite side of the Earth due to the centrifugal force caused by the Earth and moon orbiting around a common center of mass.\\n\\nAs the Earth rotates, locations experience two high tides and two low tides each day. When the sun and moon are aligned, their gravitational forces combine to create higher high tides and lower low tides, known as spring tides. When the sun and moon are at right angles to each other, their gravitational forces partially cancel out, resulting in lower high tides and higher low tides, known as neap tides.\\n\\nOverall, tides are a result of the gravitational interactions between the Earth, moon, and sun, and they play a crucial role in shaping coastal ecosystems and influencing navigation and fishing activities.\""

       "'Inheritance in computer science is a concept where a class (referred to as the child class or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (referred to as the parent class or superclass). This allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.\\n\\nInheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between the parent and child classes, where the child class is a specialized version of the parent class. The child class can access all public and protected members of the parent class, and can also add its own unique attributes and methods.\\n\\nInheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of hierarchies of classes that model real-world relationships. It promotes modularity, extensibility, and flexibility in software design, making it easier to maintain and update code.\\n\\nOverall, inheritance is a powerful tool in computer science that allows for the creation of more efficient and organized code structures.'"
